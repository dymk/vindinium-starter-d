vindinium-starter-d
====

A Vindinium starter written in the D language. The starter sends random
movement commands to the server. Go implement your own AI!

See the `while(c.is_running)` loop in `app.d` for an example of how to
use the kit. `game_objs.d` contains the relevant data structures that the
server responds with, and are represented as D structs.
